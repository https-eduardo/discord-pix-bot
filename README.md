## üöÄ How to run[^1]

First of all, you'll need to set up the enviroment.

Following the `.env.example`, implement `.env` file and insert the values of variables.

[^1]: PS: You have to provide an API for handling backend, like my recommendation in the top of this text.

```bash
# development
$ yarn dev

# production mode
$ yarn start
```
